        A wed designer ia an individual that makes their living by designing and maintaining web sites. This is a field that has evolved extremly quickly over the past decade, but the fundamentals still remain the same. Any web desighner must have a strong understanding of the HTML language. Contrary to what most people beleive HTML is not a programmimg language, but a formatting language developed by <strong>Tim Burners-Lee</strong> in 1989. Since its original development HTML has come a long way and has incorporated a multitude of new features. HTML allowed for the development of the WorldWideWeb and the explosive popularity of the internet!<br>
        As HTML elvolved, developers soon realized that the stucture of web pages should be defined using html, and that pages style, look, and feel, should be defined seperately, thus the birth of cascatig style sheets. Now developers use HTML to define what the information on the web page is, such as a headung content, article content, a paragraph with in the article, or footer, ect. Cascading sheets were designed to define the colors of document, the size, margins, colors, and positioning of the various elements of the web page.<br>
        About the time the HTML and the WorldWideWeb were hitting the public sector, PHP was being developed to make web pages a more powerful tool. PHP is a scripting language that is written directly on the web page and interpreted by the web server which would send the final version of the web page to the visitors's browser. About a year later, <strong>Netscape</strong> released the first version of JavaScript. JavaScript is also a scripting language, but unlike PHP, JavaScript is interpreted by the visitors browser rather than the web server. As a result JavaScript is not as powerful as PHP and lacks the ability tp interact with a database, but still provides processing funtionality to a web page. Web designers now days must not only be proficient in HTML and CSS, but a variety of scripting language as well. Even though HTML was the first language of the web many more have come along but still remains the fundamental structure that the web page is built from.
