            <strong>Article 1:</strong> This section will have two articles grouped together, usually for positioning purposes so we will use them more in later lessons.Elements may also be grouped together in a section to so that the area of the page grouped by the section can be formatted with the same style, or background color such as this example.

        </article>
        <strong>Article 2:</strong> The articles do not necessarily have to go inside he section , however if the articles are to be formatted into a single container, for example they need to be positioned or sized together, you can achieve this by placing both im a section and formatting the section. The articles will inherit the formatting applied to thr section
        <article style= "background-color:#ffffcc">
            <strong>Article 3:</strong> This article is not inside the section. The content of this article will not inherit any formatting applied to the section above.
